The jobs are great for everyone, but some jobs are so great that they can give children a better life. There is a survey about the working world's first general andural knowledge, and the result is that there are more than 2, 000 jobs in the world. That's a lot of different jobs that some of the younger generations might not be able to do. There are so many more examples that it is impossible to choose the best job for children.

The United Nations (UN) is an example of this. Many countries have signed agreements with the UN that they will work together and make full use of the environment, and that the environment is not damaged. The UN also signed an agreement to reduce the use of ""fossil fuels"" in the world's electricity and natural resources, and drive cleaner, and serve more people.
