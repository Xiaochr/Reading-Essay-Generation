One night, he saw fireflies outside his house and came up with an idea. He caught some fireflies in a bag and hung the bag up as a lamp. It is said that he spent all of his summer nights reading like this. Another child named Sun Kang also loved reading. One night during winter, Sun used up all of his lamp oil and couldn't study at night. When he woke up at midnight, he saw the snow reflecting the moonlight outside his house. ""Oh, I can use the reflected light to read! "" he thought. He took out his books and read, even though he was cold. Both of the children later became successful government officials. People turned their stories into the Chinese idiom nangyingyingxue."
1,"You may have heard of people who are allergic to seafood, smoke or pets. But did you know that some people were allergic to Wi-Fi signals? Rose White, a 44-year-old woman from Britain, first found herself being allergic to Wi-Fi signals in 2015. She had a cough, heart trouble and great pains in her head when she stayed at the places covered with Wi-Fi signals. Rose has tried many ways to keep away from Wi-Fi signals. In the past six months, she either slept in her car or in a tent which she had put up in the woodland and in the fields. She even tried sleeping in a shed. Being completely tired, Rose had no choice but to quit her job and moved 370 kilometers away from her home to avoid Wi-Fi signals, but failed. Because of the hard life, she got a stomach problem. She is now living in a small house in the rural area in England. There are far fewer Wi-Fi signals. However, the house, which belongs to her friend, will be sold to others, so she has to move again soon. Rose is planning to move to a more rural area. She is also planning to buy a camper van so that she can drive away from Wi-Fi signals whenever she is feeling uncomfortable. As she cannot work to make money, she has to raise money online. She is hoping to raise 15, 000 pounds. So far, she has raised over 1, 600 pounds. She still has a long way to go."

He asked the beggar if had like to have lunch with him, and the beggar agreed. So, they went into a small restaurant and had a good meal. At the end the man could not pay the bill. Of course, the beggar had to do so. The young man was very sorry about this, so he said to the beggar, ""Come home with me in a taxi, my friend, and I'll give you back the money for lunch. ""Oh, no! "" the beggar answered quickly. I have to pay for your taxi home too! """
3,"I remembered one of my classmates. Her name was Lucy. Once she brought a new doll to kindergarten. The toy was very pretty. All the girls liked it and even the boys liked it. Everyone played with it happily. When I played with it, I broke it by accident. Lucy cried. At first I didn't know what to do. Then I decided to give her a similar doll. It looked like the broken one. I asked my parents to buy it for me for my 6th birthday. I didn't ask for my own birthday gift. They bought a doll on Sunday. I gave Lucy that doll on Monday. It was also my birthday. The girl was very happy. And all of my classmates were very happy, too. Then at dinner, my dad gave me my own gift-a new robot. He said I did the right thing, and my parents were proud of me."
4,"On a sunny afternoon, my father and I were reading together in the living room. My father was enjoying himself reading his favorite short story writers' works. Suddenly he passed me one of them. I read it for a while and then looked at him and said, ""Why not write a story myself? If you like it, give me a prize! "" He agreed happily. Back to my room I concentrated on writing. But when the draft still hardly gave me satisfaction, hopelessness filled my heart. Then I went past the living room to the study secretly for help, where I found an interesting story. I was so excited that I took down everything I needed. Then I took the story to my father. He finished reading, nodded and smiled, ""It is excellent, Jay. I am quite sure you can get what you want. "" Then he pointed at a line, ""Writing really needs study and imagination. I can tell you're a creative boy from this sentence. So there is nothing I can change. "" I listened to his praise. What he said made me embarrassed. I didn't feel like a winner. Mark Twain should have won the prize, because he was the writer of the book. I stepped back a bit and said, ""Dad, I'm sorry. I copied the story from a book. I guessed you might not I have read it, so. . . "" ""Jay, I am glad that you can realize your mistake He patted my head and continued, ""I know, you want to show your passion for writing to me. But, no matter what you want to do, honesty always comes first. Remember? """
5,"Some people say extreme sports are dangerous-and they're probably right-but hey, if you're not afraid of getting hurt, you might as well do it with style! It is. reported that regular sports are not completely safer than extreme ones. Here is an introduction to three new extreme sports. South Africa and Jacksonville, Florida, USA are the two homes of ostrich racing. Why do some guys like to attend this extreme sport? The show is that sometimes four or even ten ostriches are marching forward and at a time, and this is seriously strange. For the supporters, there's a chance to ride an ostrich. Although if you don't want to be bitten or kicked, you can use carts like ostriches for racing instead. BASE represents several words-Buildings, Antennae, Spans, Earth. Spans means bridges and Earth means cliffs, but then the beauty of BASE jumping is that it's just launching yourself from anywhere possible with a parachute ready to go. Although BASE jumping dates back to 1978, it has been popular quite a lot recently because there are pieces of videos on the Internet and every jump is a new possibility. The bird man suit has a few names-the flying squirrel suit, wing-suit and bat-suit, it's a specially designed suit that lets you glide through the air at controlled speeds-adding a little extra to your usual skydiving experience. This is probably the closest we are going to fly. If combining this with BASE jumping, you'll get some serious death-defying excited feelings."

One day, he noticed a homeless guy at the station at night. He felt pity for him, so he gave him some change from his pocket. The homeless guy thanked him for it. The next day, he noticed the homeless guy again at the same place. This time Steve offered him something to eat. The homeless guy thanked him for his kindness. But Steve got surprised and asked him, ""How did you get to this point? "" The homeless guy looked up at him smilingly and said, ""By showing love. "" Steve didn't understand it, so he asked him, ""What do you mean by that? "" The homeless guy answered, ""Throughout my whole life, I made sure that everyone was happy. No matter what was going right or wrong in my life, I always helped everyone. "" Steve asked him, ""Do you regret it? "" The homeless guy answered, ""No. It just hurts my heart that the people I helped wouldn't give me a hand when I was in need. Son, it is better to build your own house and invite someone in for shelter than to hand them your bricks while you are building yours. If not, you will probably be the person who looks for shelter.

7,"Last summer, I moved from a tiny city in England to one of the 1argest and most populated cities in the world. As the plane touched down in Beijing, I felt excited that I'd finally arrived after months of planning. One of the first things I did was to visit one of the city's hutong. Walking around the narrow streets, I saw local Beijingers clothes hanging in the yard and the elderly playing Chinese chess in the sunlight. This was the first moment I thought, ""Yes, I'm in China. "" Beijing couldn't be more different to my hometown, Preston, which has a population of just 114, 000. On Sunday, all the shops close at 4: 00 p. m. there. There isn't a lot of choice when it comes to restaurants, either. As a fan of food. I couldn't wait to see what Beijing here has to offer. I haven't found a favourite Chinese dish here yet-I'm still happily working my way through Beijing's countless restaurants to try to figure that out. My adventure in China is only just beginning. I hope to see many other cities of China. My dream is to travel across the country, taking photos and meeting new people along the way."
8,"Raj Pabari is a student in California, the US. He has many hobbies. Finding ways to solve problems is one of his favorite hobbies. The 15-year-old is used to distance learning, since his school often uses it. But many students are having a hard time keeping up with their studies at home because of the novel coronavirus outbreak. To help these students, Pabari has started a new online tutoring service. Tutors for Good, which Pabari created after the quarantine began in mid-March, offers free peer-to-peer tutoring for different subjects every week. If students need more help, extra half-hour sessions cost 15 dollars (about 105 yuan). Pabari's father is a businessman. Following in his father's footsteps, Pabari started his first business at the age of 10. He taught older adults how to use their electronic devices. More recently, he tutored fellow students in the subjects of math and debate. When schools closed and he could no longer do in-person tutoring, he came up with the idea for his online service. He uses the Zoom video conferencing app and a whiteboard so that both tutors and students can work on problems at the same time. Since starting tutorsforgood, com, Pabari has asked other Classical Academy students to serve as tutors. Lillie Eckstein, a junior, is offering tutoring in biology and chemistry. Besides looking for other tutors, Pabari said he hoped to find companies who would pay the tutors to provide more free services for the students in need. ""Students are missing the social aspects of being at school, "" Pabari said. ""Tutoring over Zoom is not quite the same, but it is like socializing over Zoom, """
9,"Mr. Lee gave each of his students a sunflower seed to plant. He told them they should take care ofthe plant and that they would collect some seeds when the flower got old. Roy was so excited that he planted the seed and looked after it with great care for many days. When the first leaf came out, he went to see Mr. Lee. ""When can I have sunflower seeds? "" he asked. The teacher answered that he would still have to take care of the plant for quite some time. Roy had to look after the plant every day. However, he became more and more impatient day by day. He kept asking his teacher when he could collect the seeds every day. Though the teacher asked him to be patient, Roy cut off the flower to eat the seeds as soon as he saw the sunflower's seeds. But the seeds were still too young to be eaten. The boy was so sad. He spent so much time caring for the sunflower, but had nothing in the end because he was impatient."
10,"Do you know how to make friends with a group of people? Let me tell you the steps about making friends with the group. Maybe it's helpful to you. First, you need to know what kind of group they are. If people of the group are shy, never ask them ""Why don't you talk? "" ""Why are you quiet? "" or ""Why do you look shy? "" They don't like such questions. Next, remember that each group is different. They may use different words, like different things or have different ways of ""hanging out"". Then, the important thing is that you should try to be outgoing. If you are outgoing, you would become very popular. Remember, nobody wants to make friends with a shy person. Finally, find a right topic talk with the group. For example, you can talk with them about the weather, the news, their hobbies or their school life."
11,"Sometimes people come into your life and you come to realize that they were meant to be there. You never know who these people may be (possibly your roommate, neighbor, co-worker, long-lost friend, lover, or even a complete stranger) , but when you lock your eyes on them, you know immediately that they will affect your life in some profound way. And sometimes things happen to you that may seem horrible, painful, and unfair at first, but in reflection you find that without overcoming those difficulties you would have never realized your potential, strength, willpower or heart. Everything happens for a reason. Nothing happens by chance or by means of good luck. Illness, injury, love, brilliant achievement, and sheer stupidity all happen to test the limits of your soul. Without these small tests, whatever they may be, life would be like a smooth, straight, flat road to nowhere. The people you meet who affect your life, and the success and downfalls you experience, help to make of who you are and who you become. Even the bad experiences can be learned from. In fact, they are probably the most important ones. If someone hurts you, betrays you, or breaks your heart, forgive them, for they have helped you learn about trust and the importance of being careful when you open your heart. If someone loves you, love them back, not only because they love you, but because in a way, they are teaching you to love and how to open your heart and eyes to things. Make every day count. Appreciate every moment and take from those moments everything that you possibly can, for you may never be able to experience it again. Talk to people that you have never talked to before, and attentively listen. Tell yourself you great and believe in yourself, for if you don't believe in yourself, it will be hard for others to believe in you. You can make of your life anything you wish. Take care of your own life, make it better and live it with no regrets. Most importantly, if you love someone, tell him or her, for you never know what tomorrow may have in store."
12,"Something interesting may happen every day. I will tell you one. When I went to lunch one day, I noticed an old man sitting on a park bench crying. I was surprised, so I stopped and asked him what was wrong. He told me, ""I have a lot of money and I have a 22-year-old wife at home. She is very beautiful. She is kind to me and looks after me well. Every morning she wakes me up and make me pancakes, sausage, and coffee. "" I continued, ""Well, then why are you crying? "" He added, ""She makes me homemade soup and my favorite biscuits for lunch, cleans the house and then watches sports shows with me for the rest of the afternoon. "" I said, ""Well, why are you crying? "" He said, ""For dinner she makes me a meal with wine and my favorite dessert and then we watch TV together and talk with each other happily. I asked, ""Well then, why in the world are you crying? "" He replied, ""I can't remember where I live. And I don't know who I am. """
13,"Once upon a time there were three little pigs. One day their mother said to them, ""You are too big to live here. You need to build your own houses. But make sure that the wolf can't catch you. ""The first little pig built his house with grass. It was the easiest thing to do. The second little pig built his house with sticks, which was a little bit stronger than the grass house. The third little pig built his house with bricks, which was the strongest but took him a lot of time. One day the wolf came and saw the first little pig in his grass house. The wolf pushed down the house and ate the first little pig. Then the wolf came to the stick house and pushed down that house too. Then he ate the second little pig. The wolf then came to the house of bricks, but he could not push down that brick house. The wolf climbed up to the roof and tried to get in through the chimney. The smart little pig fired and boiled water on it. When the wolf fell down, he fell into the hot water and died."

15,"Mia has written an article about ""the Mona Lisa"" for the school newspaper. ""The Mona Lisa"" is probably the most famous painting in the world. Leonardo Da Vinci began painting the Mona Lisa in 1502. In 1516 he moved from Italy to France and the king of France bought the painting. The painting became well-known in the mid-19th century. The Mona Lisa's smile was so mysterious. The missing eyebrows and eyelashes made the Mona Lisa even more mysterious. The Mona Lisa has been stolen and damaged several times. In 1911 a man working for the Lourve Museum stole the painting because he believed that the Mona Lisa belonged to Italy. He kept the painting in his flat for two years. The police caught him when he tried to sell it. In 1913 Italy returned the painting to France. Now, the Mona Lisa is kept behind bullet-proof glass in the Louvre Museum. About 6 million people view the painting each year."

18,"I love cherry blossoms. When spring comes around, I always visit festivals for the lovely flowers. The ones in Japan, China, and Republic of Korea are wonderful. This year, I'll be at the National Cherry Blossom Festival in Washington, DC. There are 1. 5 million visitors there every year. I can't wait to visit the city with over 3, 700 cherry trees. Some cherry blossoms are from the original 3, 000 trees from 1912. They were a gift from the mayor of Tokyo. They stand for the friendship between Japan and the US. The festival is three weeks long and full of fun events. It starts with an exciting kite festival, and I plan to join in the kite flying competition. I won't have time to do everything. However, I won't miss taking a bike ride. I won't miss the traditional shows with Japanese artists, either. I'll also be there when they light the Japanese stone lantern. It was another gift from Japan and is almost 400 years old. There's so much beauty and fun at the National Cherry Blossom Festival."

They decided to knock down their living room wall to open up the space. When the wooden walls were removed, they were shocked to find a lizard stuck in the small space between the walls. The lizard's foot was stuck by a nail, which was hammered from the other side of the wall. Mrs White reminded him that they hammered a nail to hang up their kids photo. However, they questioned how the lizard had stayed alive so long without moving from that place. So Mr White stopped his work and watched the lizard: what has it been doing? What and how has it been eating? Later, he didn't know from where another lizard appeared carrying food to the stuck lizard's mouth. That was a real surprise! This act was heartwarming, and he was moved deeply by the little animal. The free lizard had been feeding the stuck one for more than two years! The lizard carried the hope of survival, even in a difficult situation. Both lizards had never-ending hope for each other and carried their hearts with love and care. Such love, a beautiful love! Such love happened with this tiny animal. Why can't we humans always carry that kind of love in our hearts? Life is full of all kinds of difficulties. What we can do is to give our hands to the one in need and share our love. Sharing is caring."

23,"Dear Meimei, I'm glad to hear from you. But I'm sorry to know that you don't have a good time these days. From your letter I know you are very lonely. You don't know how to chat with your classmates because you do not share the same interests. Here are some suggestions for you. To make friends, you must first be friendly. Everyone likes a friendly girl with a smile. Second, give your classmates a compliment. Say something nice about their styles or skills. Then ask a question to start chatting. Third, find out what interests them. Talk about that even if it doesn't interest you. Ask your classmates questions and let them be the experts. The conversation is more important than the topic. Finally, talk to more people. Say hello to someone new. Sit with different groups of people in the cafeteria. If one person doesn't want to talk with you, then find someone else to chat with. Don't just think about being lonely. Do something about it! Smile and say hello to people even if they aren't your friends. Doing things differently will help produce different results. Yours, Jordon"

So the city has two parts: the South and the North. In the North, there are important buildings, shops, big parks and interesting places. The weather in London is fine all year round. In winter it is not very cold and in summer it is not very hot because the city is near the sea. People used to say London was a foggy city and it often rained. It was true.

28,"Regularly reduces your risk of skin cancer. Anything over 30 minutes in the sun needs protection of some kind of sunscreen, especially children who are more susceptible to sunburn. You should try to use the right sunscreen for your skin. The more natural your sunscreen is, the better it will be for your skin. You can use a kind of sunscreen with the SPF of at least 30. You also need to apply it every few hours while outdoors. Some newer sunscreen has SPF 45 or higher. Applying sunscreen only once is not enough. You should also reapply sunscreen after you've been in the water or if you've been sweating. The more sunburn you experience in your life, the higher the risk of getting skin cancer will be in the future. This idea is right especially when you are younger. Although sunscreen stops UV radiation, many products contain chemicals that increase your risk of getting skin cancer. Therefore, you don't have to use too much of it if sunscreen is less needed. Sunscreen also stops the production of vitamin D in your skin. However, vitamin D is necessary and it has some advantages. For example, it is good for our bones. Therefore, it's a good idea to eat more foods which contain vitamin D. You should apply some sunscreen on your skin if you need to spend some time in the sun. Sunscreen protects your skin from harmful UV radiation. Applying sunscreen"

I: On our show this morning, we're very pleased to have Jorvid from Tajikistan. He's 23, and he's studying Chinese here in Beijing.

J: Well, many of them have never heard of Tajikistan. I have brown hair and blue eyes, so when they meet me for the first time, people often ask, ""Are you from America? "" or ""Are you from Europe?

I: Can you tell us a little bit about Tajikistan? J: Sure. It's a country in Central Asia, west of China and north of Afghanistan. We became an independent country in 1991, when the Soviet Union disintegrated. But we Tajiks have quite a long history. More than a thousand years ago, a Tajik king called Somoni ruled a large area of Central Asia."
